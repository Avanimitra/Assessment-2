# Assessment-2

This is a repo of solved assessment from Availity

This repo consists of only a zipped file.

That attached zip file contains two directories. One contains the main project directory where I've stored my assessment solution. The other directory contains external libraries required to run the program if the environment isn't properly configured during evaluation.

Thank you :)
